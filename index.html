            In this era of prompt development huaman society are the most interconnected, dynamic and proporous than it
            had ever been. However the problem that afflicts human society through its history has never stop. According
            to research 56 million people died in 2017 and a major cause to these were disease, for instance the
            Cardiovascular disease killed 17.79 million people and the respiratory disease killed over 6 million
            people <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death">(1)</a>. Two of them added could take over half
            of the death toll. What are the possible cause of these
            deadly diseases? It was shown that a major cause led to heart and lung disease was smoking. Smoking could
            led to cancer, heart disease, stroke lung disease, and chronic obstructive plumnory disease. A cessation of
            smoking is therefore a rational way to prevent these diseases. When we look into the realities of smoking it
            shows that nearly 9 out of 10 adult smoker started before age 18, and about 3 out of 4 high school smoker
            will become adult smoker <a

            How has different countries performed about smoking? Statistic shows that the share of smoker of men and
            women age 15 and older are around 25% in countries like China and Pakistan and around 35% in countries like
            France, German, and other European states. These showed a clear distinction between the two regions. Another
            set of data shows the sum of total applicable taxes on the weight of average price of tobacco.In countries
            like France, German and other European states taxation are at range of 70% to 90% while in countries like
            China and Pakistan the taxation are in range of 40% to 70% <a
                href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death"></a>. It was clear that countries with greater
            percentage of smoker had impose heavier taxation. But despite of the high taxation why is the percentage of
            smoker still so high in European countries? The answer could probably be found from the per capita income of
            that region. Higher the per capita income could means greater flexiblity in consumption.In Europe where the
            per capita income is top in the world the percentage and prevalance of smoking is high.To further prove this
            we can take example of Africa. In Africa the prevalence of smoking is only around 5% to 10% and per capita
            income is few of the lowest in the world.This drawed a clear contrast between the two region

            Other than the per capita income the voice and attitude of country's civil is a unignorable factor.The
            newspaper for example is a very important way in spreading awareness and create unity against smoking and
            other health issues.In Pakistan 30.4% of news coverage are on politics, 20.6% on governance, 14.9% on state
            institutions.8.3% on foreign policy, 6.65% on terrorism, 2.5% on corruption, 4% on non state institutions,
            6% on violence and 4% on crime and injustice <a
                href="https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2015/07/28/media-giving-lowest-coverage-to-human-rights-social-justice-report/">(4)</a>.
            The coverage for health and disease barely exist.This may
            led to a lack of puclic awareness of health and effects of smoking and consequently greater possibilty of
            smoking. In Pakistan 1,200 children are getting addicted to smoking,hope more awareness and preventive
            measures could be taken.

            Pycologists shows that when a person smokes a dose of nicotine reaches the brain and would improve mood and
            concentration,decrease stress, and relax muscles for that moment.But in long term smoking may cause physical
            symptom like headache or breathlessness as well as making people feel irritable anxious or low. Could

            While Econmoists stated that without the cultivation of tobacco, manufacture of tobacco products and
            distribution and sale of products, a country's economy will suffer devastating economic consequences. Job
            will be lost, income will fall, tax revenue will plumnet <a
                href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/9/1/78/">(6)</a>.For a country's government it is a
            extremely
            difficult to choose between the publiuc health and country's economy, most countries prefer to keep a state
            of balance between the two which is what we see now a days.
